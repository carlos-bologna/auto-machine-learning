# My Auto Machine Learning
### Because ML tasks, sometimes, is repetitive...

A friend of mine said me once: "the maximum number of times that I do some task are two. The third one will already be automated."

> The first question you may ask me: why did you use Rust to make the orchestrator? R: just because I would like to learn a new language.

# Setup
I tried to make this project collaborative, so, you can add you own module if you want to. To make it possible, without you have to understand the whole project, I separated the project in several Docker images. The orchestrator is responsible to run each one. So, the orchestrator is the boss.
